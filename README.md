# Capital-Punishment-Analysis

This is an ongoing project and files will be updated as the project progresses. 

Capital punishment in the United States has a long and controversial history. Some states have never had the death penalty, others have had it for over 100 years, and others have relatively recently adopted capital punishment. In 1972 the Supreme Court in Furman v Georgia passed a de facto moratorium on capital punishment throughout the United States. Since then, some states have reinstated capital punishment as an appropriate ruling to violent crimes. 

The is complex, with many factors affecting both sides of the argument. As such, the debate continues, and there is no clear conclusion to be drawn on the subject. In my analysis, I will investigate the **deterrent** efect of capital punishment; In other words, does capital punishment change the rate of violent crime committed? There are many analyses about capital punishment that could be asked - such as an economic analysis - but for the time being I will focus only on deterrence. 

This question is not a novel one, in fact the inspiration for this project comes from reading an [academic paper](https://cjlf.org/deathpenalty/DezRubShepDeterFinal.pdf) published in Emory University's Journal Department of Economics asking the same question in 2002. 

This paper inspired me for two main reasons:

 * As a mathematician, I wanted to understand more about the models for inference used, particularly in such a sensitive and serious issue. 
 * The conclusion was that capital punishment deters 8 future murders. In 16 years time since this publication, are we able to analyze the data better, and reach a better conclusion?
 
 
 My analysis will follow 5 sections:
 
 * **Section 1:** Identifying the dataset and giving historical context to help understand the data itself, as well as what specific data is necessary and which is unecessary for this analysis. 
 * **Section 2:** Creating the tools necessary for the analysis. 
 * **Section 3:** *Hypothesis testing*. What are the control groups, what type of experiment is this (is it a natural experiment, controlled experiement, field experiment)?. Clearly stating the hypothesis and null hypothesis 
 * **Section 4:** Simulation testing. Is the analysis due to chance?
 * **Section 5** Discussion of results, and limitations. Further discussion of what can be done to improve the analysis. 
 

Inspired by UC Berkeley's Data 8 project.
