# Capital-Punishment-Analysis

Capital punishment in the United States has a long and controversial history. Some states have never had the death penalty, others have had it for over 100 years, and others have relatively adopted capital punishment. In 1972 the Supreme Court in Furman v Georgia passed a de facto moratorium on capital punishment throughout the United States. Since then, states have reinstated capital punishment as an appropriate ruling to violent crimes. 

The is complex, with many factors affecting both sides of the argument. As such, the debate continues, and there is no clear conclusion to be drawn on the subject. In my analysis, I will investigate the **deterrent** efect of capital punishment; In other words, does capital punishment change the rate of violent crime committed?
